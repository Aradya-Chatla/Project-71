      <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">For all Xavierians, food was never scarce
         during their college days. Not just because this iconic college is on the hip and happening Park Street of
          Kolkata, surrounded by equally historic food joints, some of which are running from the British era, but 
          because the college has a very well-stocked canteen. For those who feel going to joints next door like 
          Flurys, might burn a hole in their pockets, they can always pay a visit to the St Xavier’sCanteen, housed
           within the building itself and open almost throughout the day, from 8am in the morning.St Xavier’s canteen is
            always overcrowded. Even school students from the senior section which is adjacent to the college, come in 
            hordes during their recess. One gets a lot of choices for food and drinks like puri-sabzi, chicken patties,
             sandwich, cakes, rolls, tea, coffee, ice tea and many more and waiwai being pretty much demand. This canteen
              has been running for ages and has been renovated a couple of times. The new addition is a giant screen, 
              where students crowd during matches or tournaments. Students come and sit and study as well. Why only 
              students, even professors are fond of visiting the canteen, if not for anything else but for a cup of tea
               maybe!</p>

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >1. Accuracy
Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management
 systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate
  data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
<br>
2. Economics
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to 
inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a 
study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated
 attendance management systems.
<br>
3. Productivity / Efficiency
Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to 
process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up
recious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to
 automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps
  in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like

    Security, and Compliance
